Predicting wine quality using Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) based on physicochemical test results from the WineQT dataset. Includes EDA, model evaluation, and visualizations.

# Wine Quality Prediction using MLR

This project applies *Multiple Linear Regression* to predict wine quality based on various chemical attributes of red wine samples. Using the WineQT.csv dataset (1144 samples), we explore feature correlations, build regression models, and evaluate their performance using R² and RMSE.

The project demonstrates:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Comparison between Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
- Model performance visualization
